To run these tests, put the `kwasow.rs` file in the root directory of your rust project
and add the below line on top of the `main.rs` file:

```rust
mod kwasow;
```

These tests only test edge-cases described in the task. They don't test if your solution
is actually stable and resistant to errors or has safe concurrent access.
